@/*! \file synch.h 
    \brief Data structures for synchronizing threads.
  
  	Three kinds of synchronization are defined here: semaphores,
  	locks, and condition variables. Part or all of them are to be
  	implemented as part of the first assignment.
  
  	Note that all the synchronization objects take a "name" as
  	part of the initialization.  This is solely for debugging purposes.

/*! \brief Defines the "semaphore" synchronization tool
//
// The semaphore has only two operations P() and V():
//
//	P() -- decrement, then wait if the value becomes < 0
//
//	V() -- increment, waking up a thread waiting in P() if necessary
// 
// Note that the interface does *not* allow a thread to read the value of 
// the semaphore directly -- even if you did read the value, the
// only thing you would know is what the value used to be.  You don't
// know what the value is now, because by the time you get the value
// into a register, a context switch might have occurred,
// and some other thread might have called P or V, so the true value might
// now be different.

/*! \brief Defines the "lock" synchronization tool
//
// A lock can be BUSY or FREE.
// There are only two operations allowed on a lock: 
//
//	Acquire -- wait until the lock is FREE, then set it to BUSY
//
//	Release -- wake up a thread waiting in Acquire if necessary,
//	           or else set the lock to FREE
//
// In addition, by convention, only the thread that acquired the lock
// may release it.  As with semaphores, you can't read the lock value
// (because the value might change immediately after you read it).

  //! in Release, and in Condition variable operations below.

  Thread * owner;        //!< Thread who has acquired the lock

/*! \class Condition 
\brief Defines the "condition variable" synchronization tool
//
// A condition
// variable does not have a value, but threads may be queued, waiting
// on the variable.  These are only operations on a condition variable: 
//
//	Wait() -- release the lock, relinquish the CPU until signaled, 
//		then re-acquire the lock
//
//	Signal() -- wake up a thread, if there are any waiting on 
//		the condition
//
//	Broadcast() -- wake up all threads waiting on the condition
//
// All operations on a condition variable must be made while
// the current thread has acquired a lock.  Indeed, all accesses
// to a given condition variable must be protected by the same lock.
// In other words, mutual exclusion must be enforced among threads calling
// the condition variable operations.
//
// In Nachos, condition variables are assumed to obey *Mesa*-style
// semantics.  When a Signal or Broadcast wakes up another thread,
// it simply puts the thread on the ready list, and it is the responsibility
// of the woken thread to re-acquire the lock (this re-acquire is
// taken care of within Wait()).  By contrast, some define condition
// variables according to *Hoare*-style semantics -- where the signalling
// thread gives up control over the lock and the CPU to the woken thread,
// which runs immediately and gives back control over the lock to the 
// signaller when the woken thread leaves the critical section.
//
// The consequence of using Mesa-style semantics is that some other thread
// can acquire the lock, and change data structures, before the woken
// thread gets a chance to run.
*/
class Condition {
public:
  //! Create a condition and initialize it to "no one waiting"
  Condition(char* debugName);

  //! Deallocate the condition
  ~Condition();

  //! For debugging
  char* GetName() { return (name); }
  
  void Wait(); 	// these are the 3 operations on 
                // condition variables; releasing the 
                // lock and going to sleep are 
                // *atomic* in Wait()
  void Signal();     // conditionLock must be held by
  void Broadcast();  // the currentThread for all of 
                     // these operations
