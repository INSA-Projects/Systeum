@/*! \file oftable.h
   \brief Data structure used to synchronize operations on files.
  
   This data structure maintain a list of all the files open in the 
   system. It keep track of all of the files currently open. When a 
   new thread opens a file, the open table would be checked to see
   if any other thread already has it open. The processes still 
   maintain a private copy of the openfile objects. The file table
   is only used to synchronise accesses to these files.
